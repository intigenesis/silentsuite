"""Reusable-workflow caller/callee permission-subset contract.

GitHub evaluates a caller job's `permissions` against the permissions requested
by the jobs of the local reusable workflow it invokes. A callee job may never
request more than the caller job's token holds. When a caller job omits
`permissions` it inherits the repository default grant, which is read-only for
this repository, so any callee job that asks for `packages: write` or even
`actions: read` makes the whole run fail startup validation in seconds with
zero jobs created and no deployment attempted.

`actionlint` cannot catch this. It validates one workflow file at a time
against the workflow schema and expression grammar; a caller job without a
`permissions:` key is perfectly valid YAML and a perfectly valid workflow, and
actionlint does not resolve `uses: ./.github/workflows/*.yml` to the callee's
job-level permission requests. The mismatch only exists across two files, so it
is invisible to a per-file linter and only surfaces at dispatch time — which,
for the annual public Stage B cutover, means burning an owner-approved exact
SHA window. This contract closes that gap for every checked-in local reusable
caller in the repository, so the currently unwired deploy-server sibling cannot
be called later without the same validation.
